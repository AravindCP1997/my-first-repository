                            <p>Businesses and investments are always exposed to different categories of risks. Hedge is any activity / transaction undertaken to avoid/ reduce the impact of those risks.</p>
                            <p>An investment in stock market is exposed to market risk. The price of the stock fluctuate subject to demand-supply movement in the market. So is the value of the investments.</p>
                            <p>Trade payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency are exposed to foreign exchange risk. Cash outflow / inflow associated with the payables / receivables fluctuate subject to variations in foreign exchange rates.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>An investor / business entity manages those risks using various market instruments or products available. Using the instruments, they reduce the impact of the risks to zero or an acceptably low level. This is hedging.</p>
                            <p>The instruments used to hedge risks usually include forward contracts, futures & options, interest rate swaps and other money market instruments.</p>
                            <p>An investment or the product, the risk on which is hedged, is termed the hedged item and the instrument with which the risk is hedged, is termed the hedging instrument.</p>

                        <h2>Hedge of Foreign Currency Trade Payables, using Forward Contracts</h2>
                        <h4>The Story</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>On 01 Jan 2025, a company has a trade payable of USD 10,000, which is due to be settled on 30 June 2025. The spot exchange rate is INR 83.00/ USD. The US Dollar has an upward trend and is expected to appreciate till 30 June 2025. The company is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk and wishes to hedge the same. On 01 Jan 2025, the company obtains a forward contract to buy USD 10,000 on 30 June 2025 at INR 87.15 /USD. By doing so the company has, in substance, limited its outflow exposure of USD 10,000 to INR 87.15/ USD. </p>
                            <p>The forward rate is INR 87.15/USD, as it forecasts the USD to appreciate 5% by 30 June 2025, from the spot rate of INR 83.00/USD, as on 01 Jan 2025, under existing market conditions.</p>

                            <p>Trade payable denominated in foreign currency is always translated using the spot rate of exchange.<p>
                            <p>Gain or loss arising from the changes in exchange rates, is recognised in the Profit or Loss.</p>

                        <div>
                            <h4>Forward Contracts</h4>
                            <p>A forward contract to buy/ sell foreign currency is a derivative. Derivative is a contract, whose value depend upon the value of an underlying asset, security / product.</p>
                            <p>Derivatives are always measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the Profit or Loss.</p>
