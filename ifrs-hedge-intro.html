                            <p>Businesses and investments are always exposed to different categories of risks. Hedge is any activity / transaction undertaken to avoid/ reduce the impact of those risks.</p>
                            <p>An investment in stock market is exposed to market risk. The price of the stock fluctuate subject to demand-supply movement in the market. So is the value of the investments.</p>
                            <p>Trade payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency are exposed to foreign exchange risk. Cash outflow / inflow associated with the payables / receivables fluctuate subject to variations in foreign exchange rates.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>An investor / business entity manages those risks using various market instruments or products available. Using the instruments, they reduce the impact of the risks to zero or an acceptably low level. This is hedging.</p>
                            <p>The instruments used to hedge risks usually include forward contracts, futures & options, interest rate swaps and other money market instruments.</p>
                            <p>An investment or the product, the risk on which is hedged, is termed the hedged item and the instrument with which the risk is hedged, is termed the hedging instrument.</p>

                        <h2>Hedge of Foreign Currency Trade Payables, using Forward Contracts</h2>
                        <h4>The Story</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>On 01 Jan 2025, a company has a trade payable of USD 10,000, which is due to be settled on 30 June 2025. The spot exchange rate is INR 83.00/ USD. The US Dollar has an upward trend and is expected to appreciate till 30 June 2025. The company is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk and wishes to hedge the same. On 01 Jan 2025, the company obtains a forward contract to buy USD 10,000 on 30 June 2025 at INR 87.15 /USD. By doing so the company has, in substance, limited its outflow exposure of USD 10,000 to INR 87.15/ USD. </p>
                            <p>The forward rate is INR 87.15/USD, as it forecasts the USD to appreciate 5% by 30 June 2025, from the spot rate of INR 83.00/USD, as on 01 Jan 2025, under existing market conditions.</p>

                            <p>Trade payable denominated in foreign currency is always translated using the spot rate of exchange.<p>
                            <p>Gain or loss arising from the changes in exchange rates, is recognised in the Profit or Loss.</p>

                            <p>A forward contract to buy/ sell foreign currency is a derivative. Derivative is a contract, whose value depend upon the value of an underlying asset, security / product.</p>
                            <p>Derivatives are always measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the Profit or Loss.</p>

                                <h4>Cost of hedge</h4>
                                <p>The
excess of forward rate (INR 87 15 / over spot rate
(INR 83 00 / is the forward premium (INR 4 15 /

the forward premium is considered as the cost of hedge
The cost of hedge is recognised in the Profit or Loss on a
systematic basis.</p>
                                <h4>Hedge Effectiveness</h4>
                                <p>A
hedge is effective when gain on hedging instrument
equates loss on hedged item or vice versa, thereby,
having zero impact in the Profit or Loss When gain on
hedging instrument does not equate loss on hedged
item, the hedge is ineffective and impacts the Profit or
Loss.</p>

                                <p>On
an interim date within a hedge period, there may
be gains and losses reflecting a hedge
ineffectiveness The ineffectiveness ( losses) is
unrealised, unless the entity settles the hedge at the
interim date.</p>
                                <p>If
the financial statements present such unrealised
gains losses separately, from the realised gains
losses and provide information about their potential
impact on the Profit or Loss, it is more relevant for
the decision making needs of the users For that
purpose, the unrealised gains or losses are recognised
and accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income and
recycled to the Profit or Loss, when realised.</p>

                            <p>However, the gain of INR 0.075/USD is unrealised, unless the entity settles the payables and the forward contract on 31 Mar 2025 itself, instead of holding up to 30 June 2025.
