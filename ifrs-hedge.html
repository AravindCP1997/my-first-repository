                            <p>Businesses and investments are always exposed to different categories of risks. Hedge is any activity / transaction undertaken to avoid/ reduce the impact of those risks.</p>
                            <p>An investment in stock market is exposed to market risk. The price of the stock fluctuate subject to demand-supply movement in the market. So is the value of the investments.</p>
                            <p>Trade payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency are exposed to foreign exchange risk. Cash outflow / inflow associated with the payables / receivables fluctuate subject to variations in foreign exchange rates.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>An investor / business entity manages those risks using various market instruments or products available. Using the instruments, they reduce the impact of the risks to zero or an acceptably low level. This is hedging.</p>
                            <p>The instruments used to hedge risks usually include forward contracts, futures & options, interest rate swaps and other money market instruments.</p>
                            <p>An investment or the product, the risk on which is hedged, is termed the hedged item and the instrument with which the risk is hedged, is termed the hedging instrument.</p>
