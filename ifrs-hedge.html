                                <h4>Cost of hedge</h4>
                                <p>The
excess of forward rate (INR 87 15 / over spot rate
(INR 83 00 / is the forward premium (INR 4 15 /
When a forward contract is used as a hedging instrument,
the forward premium is considered as the cost of hedge
The cost of hedge is recognised in the Profit or Loss on a
systematic basis.</p>
                                <h4>Hedge Effectiveness</h4>
                                <p>A
hedge is effective when gain on hedging instrument
equates loss on hedged item or vice versa, thereby,
having zero impact in the Profit or Loss When gain on
hedging instrument does not equate loss on hedged
item, the hedge is ineffective and impacts the Profit or
Loss.</p>

                                <p>On
an interim date within a hedge period, there may
be gains and losses reflecting a hedge
ineffectiveness The ineffectiveness ( losses) is
unrealised, unless the entity settles the hedge at the
interim date.</p>
                                <p>If
the financial statements present such unrealised
gains losses separately, from the realised gains
losses and provide information about their potential
impact on the Profit or Loss, it is more relevant for
the decision making needs of the users For that
purpose, the unrealised gains or losses are recognised
and accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income and
recycled to the Profit or Loss, when realised.</p>

                            <p>The forward contract forecasts the USD to appreciate 5% to INR 87.15/USD by 30 June 2025. If so, by 31 Mar 2025, USD will appreciate 2.5% to INR 85.075/ USD (spot rate) and forward rate will remain at INR 87.15/USD. The foreign exchange loss on trade payables will be INR 2.075/USD and gain on forward contracts INR 0.00/USD. Resulting in a net loss on the hedge of INR 2.075/USD, which reflects the cost of hedge for the period (INR 4.15/USD * 3/6).</p>
                            <p>However, on 31 Mar 2025, spot rate becomes INR 86.00/USD and forward rate for 30 June 2025 becomes INR 88.15/ USD. The foreign exchange loss on trade payables is INR 3.00/ USD and gain on forward contract INR 1.00/USD.</p>

                            <p>However, the gain of INR 0.075/USD is unrealised, unless the entity settles the payables and the forward contract on 31 Mar 2025 itself, instead of holding up to 30 June 2025. This potential gain of INR 0.075/ USD is presented separately from the realised gains/ losses.</p>
